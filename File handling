#we can open the file by using open function

file = open("example.txt", "r")

#"r" - Read  | "w" - Write | "a" - Append

# Read entire file
content = file.read()

# Read line by line by using for loop
for line in file:
    print(line)

# Read specific number of characters
ch = file.read(100)
# important to close file after write the data
file.close()
